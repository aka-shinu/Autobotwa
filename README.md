A modern Next.js platform built as part of an internship assignment, showcasing my ability to design and develop production-level, interactive, and animation-heavy web applications.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a fully featured service-based platform built with Next.js 14+, focusing on dynamic content experiences, 3D integrations, micro-interactions, scroll-driven animations, and a device-adaptive interface.
The application highlights how a real-world business can present its services through immersive UI, structured information flows, and responsive, high-performance design.

## Features

The platform includes multiple service sections with rich user experiences such as an animated hero section with advanced transitions, interactive showcases with category-based filtering, integrated YouTube video embeds, and testimonial layouts. It also features scroll-driven storytelling powered by Scrollama, an immersive “memories/story” experience with motion effects, and a 3D globe visualization within the logistics and coverage section. All components are fully responsive, supported by smooth animations across pages, and follow a consistent design system built on reusable UI blocks.

## Tech Stack

**Framework & Language:** Next.js 14+ with App Router, TypeScript

**Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom animations and responsive design

**Animations & 3D:** Framer Motion for component animations, React Three Fiber and Three.js for 3D graphics including globe visualizations

**UI Libraries:** Swiper for carousels, React Scrollama for scroll-based animations, Lucide React for icons, React Rough Notation for text highlighting

**Additional Tools:** React Intersection Observer for scroll detection, SVG Dotted Map for geographic visualizations


## Pages

The platform includes:

- A feature-rich homepage with animated sections
- An About page with structured company/service details
- Contact page with interaction-ready components
- Dedicated service pages with deep-dive content, filtering logic, and call-to-action sections

Each page is optimized for responsiveness, accessibility, and smooth interaction.

## Development

The project uses Next.js 14+ with TypeScript and follows modern React patterns with component-based architecture. Custom hooks manage scroll behavior, animations, and filtering logic. The codebase is organized with separate directories for components, constants, hooks, utilities, and type definitions.

## AI-Assisted Components

Several components in this project were developed with assistance from AI tools, primarily v0:

- Hero component using v0
- Responsive design implementation using v0
- Marquee component using v0
- MemorySection component, especially the scroll hijacking part
- Logistics page (entire page using AI except the globe component)
- FAQ Section using v0

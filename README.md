A modern Next.js platform built as part of an internship assignment, showcasing my ability to design and develop production-level, interactive, and animation-heavy web applications.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a fully featured service-based platform built with Next.js 14+, focusing on dynamic content experiences, 3D integrations, micro-interactions, scroll-driven animations, and a device-adaptive interface.
The application highlights how a real-world business can present its services through immersive UI, structured information flows, and responsive, high-performance design.

## Features

The website includes multiple service offerings with dedicated pages for car rental, luxury cars, and logistics. The homepage features a hero section with animated car transitions, destination showcases, travel car listings with filtering capabilities, YouTube video integration, testimonials, and an interactive memories story section. The logistics section includes detailed service information, coverage areas, and story-based presentations. All pages are fully responsive and include smooth animations powered by Framer Motion and Three.js.

## Tech Stack

**Framework & Language:** Next.js 14+ with App Router, TypeScript

**Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom animations and responsive design

**Animations & 3D:** Framer Motion for component animations, React Three Fiber and Three.js for 3D graphics including globe visualizations

**UI Libraries:** Swiper for carousels, React Scrollama for scroll-based animations, Lucide React for icons, React Rough Notation for text highlighting

**Additional Tools:** React Intersection Observer for scroll detection, SVG Dotted Map for geographic visualizations


## Pages

The platform includes:

- A feature-rich homepage with animated sections
- An About page with structured company/service details
- Contact page with interaction-ready components
- Dedicated service pages with deep-dive content, filtering logic, and call-to-action sections

Each page is optimized for responsiveness, accessibility, and smooth interaction.

## Development

The project uses Next.js 14+ with TypeScript and follows modern React patterns with component-based architecture. Custom hooks manage scroll behavior, animations, and filtering logic. The codebase is organized with separate directories for components, constants, hooks, utilities, and type definitions.

## AI-Assisted Components

Several components in this project were developed with assistance from AI tools, primarily v0:

- Hero component using v0
- Responsive design implementation using v0
- Marquee component using v0
- MemorySection component, especially the scroll hijacking part
- Logistics page (entire page using AI except the globe component)
- FAQ Section using v0
